// placeholders in the .md files at runtime before the skill prompt is sent.
// After updating these constants, manually update the two files that still hardcode models:
//   - claude-api/SKILL.md (Current Models pricing table)
//   - claude-api/shared/models.md (full model catalog with legacy versions and alias mappings)
